## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate a complete, **end-to-end machine learning workflow**, from data collection to model interpretation. Each project follows a systematic approach:

---

## 🔧 Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
- Load structured data (CSV format)
- Handle missing values and detect outliers
- Convert and encode categorical variables

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize patterns, distributions, and correlations
- Use libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Derive insights to guide feature selection

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
- Encode categorical features
- Perform feature scaling and dimensionality reduction
- Create derived features to enhance model performance

### 4. **Model Building & Evaluation**
- Implement and compare classification algorithms
- Tune hyperparameters using cross-validation
- Evaluate using metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC**

### 5. **Interpretability & Business Insights**
- Analyze feature importance (especially for tree-based models)
- Extract key drivers behind predictions
- Make models actionable and business-ready
